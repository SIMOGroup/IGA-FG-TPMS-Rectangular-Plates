# IGA-FG-TPMS-Rectangular-Plates
This repository provides the basic source code of the investigation on the funtionally graded triply periodic minimal surface (FG-TPMS) plates with the following features:
- Material matrices of three TPMS structures (P, G, and IWP);
- Two functional grading paterns (A and B);
- Seventh-order shear deformation theory (SeSDT);
- Isogeometric analysis (IGA);
- Three analyses of rectangular plate (static, buckling and free vibration).
